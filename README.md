# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of car features on price and profitability in the automotive industry.By examining a dataset containing information on various car models and their specifications, I aim to provide insights that can help car manufacturers optimize their pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand.

The dataset includes variables such as car make, model, year, fuel type, engine power, transmission, wheels, number of doors, market category, size, style, estimated miles per gallon, popularity, and manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). By analyzing this dataset, I can gain insights into trends, relationships, and patterns that can inform decision-making.

## Approach
To address the business problem, I will employ various data analysis techniques in Excel, including descriptive statistics, visualization, and regression analysis. I will clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure accurate and reliable results. Our analytical methods will include pivot tables, combo charts, scatter charts with trendlines, regression analysis, bar charts, stacked bar charts, correlation analysis, and line charts. These techniques will help to explore the relationships between car features, market categories, popularity, engine power, price, fuel efficiency, and manufacturers.

## Tech-Stack Used
In this project, I will utilize Excel as our primary tool for data analysis and visualization. Microsoft Excel (2021) offers powerful functionalities such as pivot tables, charts, and regression analysis, making it suitable for exploring and analyzing the given dataset. I may also use additional Excel features such as filters and slicers to create an interactive dashboard. A choice of Excel is driven by its wide-spread availability, ease of use, and suitability for the given tasks.

## Finding Insights
### Tasks 1: Analysis
Before diving into the analysis of the given dataset, it is important to perform thorough data cleaning to ensure accurate and reliable results. You need to build an interactive dashboard in Excel from the tasks given below.

1. Insight Required: How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market categories?
2. Insight Required: What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?
3. Insight Required: Which car features are most important in determining a car's price?
4. Insight Required: How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?
5. Insight Required: What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of cylinders in a car's engine?

### Tasks 2: Building the Dashboard

1. Task 1: How does the distribution of car prices vary by brand and body style?
2. Task 2: Which car brands have the highest and lowest average MSRPs, and how does this vary by body style?
3. Task 3: How do the different feature such as transmission type affect the MSRP, and how does this vary by body style?
4. Task 4: How does the fuel efficiency of cars vary across different body styles and model years?
5. Task 5: How does the car's horsepower, MPG, and price vary across different Brands?

## Results
The interactive dashboard created in Excel allows stakeholders to explore various aspects of the dataset. They can visualize the distribution of car prices by brand and body style, compare average MSRPs across different brands and body styles, analyze the impact of transmission type on MSRP by body style, observe the trend of fuel efficiency across different body styles and model years, and understand the relationships between horsepower, MPG, and price across different car brands. 

The insights gained from the analysis provide valuable information for car manufacturers to make informed decisions regarding pricing, product development, marketing, and competitiveness in the market. By optimizing these factors, manufacturers can maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand.
